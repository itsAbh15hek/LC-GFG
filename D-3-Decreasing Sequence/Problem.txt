A sequence a[0], a[1], …, a[N-1] is called decreasing if a[i] >= a[i+1] for each i: 0 <= i < N-1. You are given a sequence of numbers a[0], a[1],…, a[N-1] and a positive integer K. In each 'operation', you may subtract K from any element of the sequence. You are required to find the minimum number of 'operations' to make the given sequence decreasing.
Note: As the answer can be large return your answer modulo 109+7.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4, K = 5
A[] = {1, 1, 2, 3}
Output:
3
Explanation:
One operation is required to change a[2] = 2
into -3 and two opertations are required to
change a[3] = 3 into -7. The resulting
sequence will be 1 1 -3 -7. Hence, in
total 3 operations are required.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N=5, K = 2
A[] = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
Output:
0
Explanation:
The sequence is already decreasing. Hence,
no operations are required in both the cases.
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minMoves() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer K as inputs and returns the minimum number of ‘operations’. Return your answer modulo 109+7.



Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
